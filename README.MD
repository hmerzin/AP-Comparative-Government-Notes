# Foundations of Comparative Politics

### Politics
- Has to do with human decisions
- Inherently social
- No such thing as _political solitaire_
- Political decisions take place within the community we call a _political system_ `public sphere`
- But most social decisions are made in a _private sphere_
- Politics is _social_, _public_, and _authoritative_

### Political Science
- The study of human decisions

### Authority
- Power vested in individuals or groups with expectations that decisions will be carried out and respected
- Those with political authority have access to _means of coercion_ to _force_ and _dominate_
- Politics ultimiteley refers to the use of authoritative and _coercive means_, who gets to employ _means of coersion_ and for what purposes

## Comparative Politics

### Subject Of Study
- Comparing the nature of politics and the political process across different political systems

### Method of study
- Comparing politics across different political systems and why we do so

## What Is A Government

### What Is A Government?
- The organizations or individuals empowered to make binding decisions on behalf of a particular community

### Nightwatchman State
- Provide defense and uphold law, not intervening in the daily lives of citizens as long as they don't break any fundamental laws

### Welfare State
- Focused on providing for the people 

### Regulatory State
- Economic controls, nationalization, regulating and intervening in certain aspects of citizens' lives

# State of Nature
- Philosopheres used their ideas about the state of nature to identify an ideal _social contract_

## Contrasting views of the State of Nature

### Thomas Hobbes
- Pessimist
- Thought that the natural state of humans was evil

### Jean Jacques-Rousseau
- Optimist
- Saw the state of nature as ideal
- Thought that humans were naturally good

### John Locke
- Believed in _limited government_
- In the middle

### Is Government the problem or the solution?
_this question is unanswered and causes a lot of tension in several states_

## Contrasting Views on the Existance of Government

### Why do some argue **for** government
- Community / Nation-Building
    - Helps create a national politcal culture
- Security and order
- Protecting property and other rights
- Promoting economic efficiency and growth
- Social Justice
- Protecting / Providing for the weak

### When does government become the **problem**
- Violation of basic rights
- Economic Inefficiency
    - Monopolies, Job Protection
- Government for private gain
    - _Rent-Seeking_: self-interested political pursuit of private gain
    - _Rents_: benefits created through government intervention in the economy
- Vested Interests
    - Individuals, groups, or firms that benefit from specific government jobs, contracts, or policies have a "special" interest in existing government; once established, agencies and policies tend to live on far beyond their usefulness (i.e. the House of Lords in the UK)

# Systems

## What is a system?

### Properties of Systems
- Has a set of interdependent parts
- Has boundaries toward outside environment with which it interacts

### What is a _Political System_
- Set of institutions, shch as parliaments, bureaucracies, and courts, that formulate and implement the collective goals of a society or of groups within it.
- Rule of _legitimagey_ preffered over _rule of force_
    - Poor legitimacy results in public policy failure
- Outside institutions such as churhces, schools, corporations, media, ect. make up outside _environment_ of political systems

### What is _Legitimacy_
- The quality or state of being legitimate
- Authenticity
- The popular acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a regime
- Basically... legitimacy is the _right to rule_

### What is a _state_
- Political system that has _sovereignty_
- What is _sovereignty_
    - Independant legal authority over a population in a particular territory, based on self-determination; sovereignty rests with political decision-makers
    - Sovereignty is never absollute; every _State_ has constraints on their internal and external sovereignty
- _Internal Sovereignty_: the right, without external intervention, to determine matters having to do with one's own citizens
- _External Sovereignty_

### _State_ vs. _Country_ vs. _Nation_ vs. _Nation-State_
- A _state_ is a political system that has sovereignty, a self-governing political entity
- What is a _country_?
    - The term _country_ can be used interchangably with _state_
- What is a _nation_?
    - A tightly-knit group of people who share a common culture
- What is a _nation-state_?
    - A _nation_ which has the same borders as a _state_

### States in the World
- The United Nations currently has 193 member-states
- **But** this does not necessarily equal the actual number of _states_ in the world
- Numbers from varying sources range from 193 to just over 200
- **And** we also have to consider _Supranational Organizations_

### What is a _Supranational Organization_?
- An international organization, or union, whereby member states transcend national boundaries or interests to share in the decision-making and vote on issues pertaining to the wider grouping
- Some such organizations are political in nature, some focus on economic matters, whereas others combine politics, economics, and social matters
- Examples of _Supranational Organizations_:
    - The European Union
    - The United Nations
    - BRICS
    - The World Bank
    - World Trade Organization

### How can _Supranational Organizations_ impact a _State's_ Sovereignty?
- _Supranational Organizations_ attempt to and / or succeed in exerting controls or authority in sovereign _states_
- Let's use the _European Union_ as our example:
    - States that join the _European Union_ have had to give up large parts of their sivereignty to this _Supranational Organization_ in order to create a common market economy that can compete globally.
    - This specific issue of sovereignty has created a lot of conflict in the United Kingdon regardin gheir membership in the EU. Should the remain in the EU or pull their membership?

### The Diversity of _States_
- Since WWII, ~127 new countries have joined the 68 _states_ that existed in 1945
    - Largest group of new _states_ in Sub-Saharan Africa
    - More than 20 new countries formed in the 1990s
        - Mostly the successor states of the Soviet Union

### The diversity of _states_
- Big and small states
    - Vatican City - smallest legally independant entity in geographic size and population
    - Russia - largest landmass
    - China and India - largest populations
- Political implications of geographic and population size?
    - Big countries are not always the most important
    -Small ones can be **very** important: Cuba, Israel, Vatican City
- No matter the grographic size, population size, or other points, of difference, **all** states face similar challenges:
    - Building community
    - Fostering economic and social development
    - Advancing democracy and civil liberties

### Challenges with Building Community
- Absence of a common identity can have severe political consequences as conflicts can occor over national, ethnic, or religious ties
    - Easier for homogeneous
- Nationality and Identity
- Language
- Religious Beliefs and Fundamentalism
    - Fundamentalism is charactarized as a backlash against modernity

### What is a _political cleavage_
- The national, ethnic, religios, and linguistic division that systematically affect political allegiances and policies
- What is a _Cumulative Cleavage_
    - Pitting the same people against each other on many different issues
- What is a _Cross Cutting Cleavage_
    - Groups that share a common interest on one issue are likely to be on opposite sides of a different issue

### Fostering Development
- A political system cannod satisfy its citizens if it does not foster social and economic development
- _Living Standards_
    - _globalization_, _democratization_, and _marketization_
    - HDI: _Human Development Index_
- Structure of the labor force
    - _Agriculture_ vs _Urbanization_
- Wide gaps in living standards still exist across countries of the world
- Productivity requires resources to develop a skilled and halthy labor force and an infrastructure that supports material welfare

### Economic Indicators
- What is _GNP_?
    - _GNP_: Gross National Product, **total economic output per person**
- What is _GDP_?
    - _GDP_: Gross Domestic Product, a measure of a country's overall economic output; **the market value of all final goods and services made within the borders of a country in a year.**
- What is _PPP_
    - _Purchasing Power Parity_

### Criteria for _Developed_ Countries
- Lower percentage of population involved in agriculture industry
- Higher literacy rates & education levels attained
- Low infant mortality rates
- Higher life expectancy
- Communication media (more telephones, radios, TVs per person)

### Problems of Economic Development
- Unequal distrivbution of resources and opportunities are among the most serious causes of political conflict
    - Large _GNP_ may conceal signiicant differences in distribution of these resources
- A country's politics are affected by internal divisions of incone, wealth, etc.
    - Some countries work to limit these divisions: India
    - Economic inequality in America is as great as several poor countries, such as China and Egypt
- First stages of industrialization may actually increase income inequality even though economic deleopment may narrow the differences eventually, but that is not guaranteed
- Another correlate of development is _population growth_
    - Generally population growth occors when popsitive things, like helath care improvement and increased living standards, occor
    - Rapid population growth, however, can pose policy challenges for many developing nations.
    - Fertility rates
    - _Coercive Politices_: China
- Economic growth can also lead to _environmental costs_
    - Despoiled forests, depleated soils and fisheries, polluted air and water, nuclear waste, endangered species

### Advancing Democracy and Civil Liberties
- _Democratization_ is the second major force transforming contemporary political systems
    - Includes the enhancement of human rights and the expnasion of freedom
- Waves of Democratization (as per Samuel Huntingon)
    - First: During the first half of the 20th century: Western States
    - Second: 1943 to 19602: newly independant satates and defeated authoritarian powers
    - Third: 1974 involving Southern Europe

## The most important general distinciton in classifying political systems is _Democratic Systems_ vs _Authoritarian Systems_

### What is  a _Democracy_
- A political system in which citizens enjoy a number of basic civil and political rights and in which their most important political sleaders are elected in free and fair electrions and are accountable under the _rule of law_
- Democracy does not gaurantee human rights and civil liverties for _everyone_

### What is _Authoritarianism_
- Lacks one or several of the defning features of a democracy
- Oligarchy: "rule of a few" important rights withheld from the majority
- Totalitarianism

# Comparing Political Systems
## Why do we compare? How do we compare? Structures and functions of Government

### Why we compare
- People study politics through comparison
- Comparative analysis helps us develop explanations and test theories of the ways in which political processes work and in which political change occors
- Comparing the past and present of our nation and comparing our experience with that of other deepens our understanding of our own institutions

### How We Compare
- Firts stage in the study of politics is description
- To describe it we need a set of concepts that are clearly defined and well understood
    - _Conceptual frameworks_
    - The easier this set of concepts is to understand and the more generally it can be applied, the more helpful it is to the study of politics

### What is a _Conceptual Framework_
- A set of concepts taht are clearly defined and well understood, which are used in order to describe politics

### The Political System Environment
- To utilize a structural-functional systems framework to compare political systems we need to discuss four general concepts
    - _System_ - suggests an object having interdependent parts, acting within a setting or an environment with boundaries towards taht outside environment
    - _Structure_ - Specialized agencies that governments create in order to carry out its many activities, such as parliaments, bureaucracies, administrative, agencies, and courts
    - _Function_ - The actions or activities assigned to or required or expected of a person or group
    - _Inputs_ - Term denoting either an enterance or changes that are inserted into a system and which activate / modify a process

### Political Systems
- What is a _political system_?
    - A set of institutions and agencies concerned iwth formulating and implementing the collective goals of a society or of groups within it
- What is _a government / the state_
    - The policymaking parts of the _politcal system_
    - Decisions of governments are normally backed up by legitimate coercion, obedience may be compelled

### Political Structures
- 6 structures in a system
- What are the 6 types of political structures
    - Legislature
    - Executive
    - Courts
    - Beaurocracies
    - Political Parties
    - Interest Groups

### Political Structures and Functions
- Structures perform functions, which in tern enable the government to formulate, implement, and enforce its policies.
    - Policies reflect the goals; the agencies provide the means
    - How might comparisons of these political structures be challenging?
        - Somse structures, such as ruling military councils or governing royal families, are found in only a few countries
        - Similar structures may have very different functions across political systems

### Political System: Process Functions
- _Process Functions_: distinctive activites _necessary for policy to be made and implemented_ in any kind of political system
    - _Interest Articulation_
        - Involves individuals and groups expressing their needs and demands
    - _Interest Aggregation_
        - Combines different demands into policy proposals backed by significant political resources
    - _Policymaking_
        - Decides what policy proposals are to become authoritative rules
    - _Policy Implimentation_
        - carries out and enforces public policies; policy adjudication settles disputes about their application

### Political System: System Functions
- _System Functions_: three additional functions which are not directly involved in making and implementing public policy - socialization, recruitment, and communication are fundamentally important
    - They determine whether or not the system will be maintained or changed
        - _Political Socialization_: involves families, schools, communications media, churches, and all the various political structures that develop, reinforce and transform the political culture, the attitudes of political significance in the soiety

### Political System: Policy Functions
- _Policy Functions (AKA Outputs)_: the implimentation of the political processes
    - The substantive impacts on society, the economy, and the culture, which include various forms of _regulation_ of behavior, _extractions_ of resources in the forms of taxes and the like, and _distribution_ of benefits and services to various groups

### Structural-Functional Approach
- Allows us to examine how the same functions are performed in different countries, or in the same country at two different points in time
- _Case Study: Russia_
    - _How could we apply this approach to Russia_
    - The govt. and its structures and functions of the 1985 Siviet Union can be compared to the government and its structures and functions of modern-day Russia.

### The Policy Level
- _Imporrtant question_: What dod the differences in structure and function do for the interest, needs, and aspirations of people?
    - The is the _policy level_ of the political system
- We call the outputs of a political system- its extractions, distributions, regulation, and symbolic acts- its _policy performance_
- Example:
    - _Input_: American spending on educaiton; more than any other people in the world
    - _Output_: U.S. children perform less well in subjects such as mathematics than do children in some other countries that spend substantially less
- The _policy level_ also includes the _outcomes of public policy_
- What are _outcomes_?
    - Information, event, object, or state of being produced as a result or consequene of a plan, process, accident, effort or other similar action or occurrence
- Outcomes generally result in _new inputs_, in _new demands_ for legislation or for _administrative action_, and in increases or decreases in the amount of support given to the political system and incumbent officeholders
    - Other forces: conditions in the internal environment, conditions in the larger external world, and simple chance may frustrate the most thoughtfully crafted programs and plans
- Evaluation
    - Assessing performance and outcomes

### How We Explain
- Once we descrive politics with the help of a conceptual framework, we then must explain it
    - Identifying the relationships between political phenomena
    - Ideally we want to put many political relationships in casual terms
- Theories are statements about casual relationships between general classes of events
    - Example: What causes democracy, war, or welfare policies?
    - Theories need to be testable
    - Good theory holds up after many trials

## Democracies

### Geographic Distribution of Power
- Federal
    - A state in which power is divided between a central authority and consituent political units
    - _Devolved_ Powers
- Unitary
    - A state in which power is centrally located and is governed as a single entity
    - Could give power and take away
- Confederal
    - Loose relationship among a number of smaller political units. The vast majority of political power rests with the local governments; the central federal government has very little power
    - Smaller govt has more power

### Parliamentry vs Presidential Systems
- Parliamentary - Prime Minster is elected by legislature
- Presidential - President is elected by people

### Proportional Representaion
- Percent of votes is percent of seats in the legislature (above a threshold)

### Electoral Rules (Parlaimentary)
- Single-member district, simple plurality ("first past the post")
- Electroal rules guarantee that one party will capture a majority of seats with a plurality of the vote

## Political Socialization

### Cultural / Political Norms
- What are "norms"
    - Behavior patterns that are typical of specific groups
    - Behaviors are learned from parents, teaches, peers and others whose values, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors take place in the context of their own organizational culture
- How do cultural norms shape politics
    - Either by citizenry using these norms to sustain their rights or to repress the rights of others
        - IE: the English use their consitiutional arrangements to sustain their liberty, while the same institutions were used as instruments of repression in South Africa and Northern Ireland

### Definitions
- Political Culture: The public attitude towards politics and their rolw within a political system
- Political Socialization: How individuals form their political attitudes / values and thus, collectively, how citizens form their political culture

### Three levels of political culture
- A nation's political culture involves 3 levels
    - Political system (system level)
    - Political and policymaking process (process level)
    - Policy outputs and outcomes (policy level)

### Political Socialization
- Political cultures are sustained or changed as people acquire their attitudes and values
- _Political socialization_ refers to the way in which political values are formed
- Can be direct or indirect
    - _Direct Socialization_ involves the explicit communication of information, values, or feelings toward politics
    - _Indirect Socialization_ occors when political views are inadvertently molded by our experiences

### Agents of Political Socialization
- Institutions and organizations that influence political attitudes

### Trends in contemporary political cultures
- democratization
- modernization
- marketization
- globalization

## Interest Groups

### Interest Articulation
- What is interest articulation?
    - Ways for people to express their wants to the government for policy changes
    - _Interest Groups_ are the primarty means for promoting political interests

### Citizen Action
- What might you do as an individual citizen
- _Voting in an election_ is the most common form of activity
- Working with others in their community
- Direct contact with govt
- Protests or other forms of contentious action
- Political consumerism

### Interest Groups
- Can occor through the action of social or political groups that represent gorups of people
- _Anomic groups_- spontaneous groups that form suddenly when many individuals resopnd similarly to frustration, disappointment, or other strong emotions
- _Non-associational groups_- based on common interests, rarely well organized, episodic
- _Associational Groups_- formed specifically to represent the interests of a particular group, generally verey active in representing interests of members in policy process, long lasting
- _Institutionsl Groups_- express their own interests or represent the interests of other groups either as corporate bodies or as smaller groups within these bodies, non-adversarial, no political conflict

### What is a _Civil Society_
- Society in which people are involves in social and political interactions _free of state control or regulation_

### Interest Group Systems
- Three types of group systems all express a unique relationship between the groups and govt. policymaking institutions
    - Pluralist
        - Multiple groups may represent a single societal interest
        - Group membership is voluntary and limited
        - Often have a loose or decentralized organizational structure
        - Clear seperation between interest groups and the govt
    - Controlled
        - Single gorup for each social sector
        - Membership often compulsory
        - Normally heirarchically organized
        - Groups are controlled by the govt or its agents in order to mobilize support for govt policy
    - Corporatist
        - Single peak association normally represents each societal interest
        - Membership in the peak association is often compulsory and nearly universal
        - Centrally organized and direct the actions of their members
        - Involved in making and implimenting policy
        - Tripartite decision-making often controls policymaking: labor, business, & government

### Access to the influential
- To be effective, interest groups must be able to reach key policymakers through channels of political acess.
    - Legitimate and constitutional channels of access
    - Illigitimate, corercive access channels

### Legitimate Access Channels
- Personal connections
    - Face-to-face contact is one of the most effective means of shaping attitudes and conveying messages
- Mass media
- Political Parties
- Legislatures
- Government bureaucracies

### Coercive Access Channels and Tactics
- Feelings of relative deprivation motivate people to act aggressively
    - Source of frustration, discontent and anger
    - Greater discontend / anget yields greater probability of collective violence

### Interest Group Development
- Varied possibilities for letigimate and coercie interest articulation exist in each country
- Successful democratic development leads to the emergence of complex interest group systems
    - Not automatic
    - Many problems involved
        - Levels of trust shared among members of society
        - Authoritarian parties may suppress groups

### What is interest aggregation
- The activitiy in which political demands of individuals and groups are combined into policy programs
- How interests are aggregated is a key feature of the political process
    - In a democratic system, two or more parties compete for support for their alternitave policy programs
    - Authoritarian - try to get support for their their policies
        - Covert and controlled
- Parties mobilize support for policies and candidates especially related to interest aggregation

### Parton - Client Networks
- Structure in which a central officeholder, authority figure, or group provides benefits to supporters in exchange for their loyalty
    - Defining principal of _feudalism_
- Primitave structure our of which larger and more complicated political structures are composed

### Institutional Interest Aggregation
- Modern society and interest aggregation
    - Citizens aware of larger collective interests; have resources and skills to work for them
    - Personal networks tend to be regualted, limited and incorporated within broader organizations
- Institutional Groups
    - Bureaucratic agencies and military groups are inistiutional groups that can be important to interest aggregations

### Party System and Interest Aggregatio
- In many contemporary political systems, parties are the primary structures of interest aggregation
- Political parties are groups or organizations that sek to place candidates in office under their label
    - _Competitiive party systems_ seek to build electoral support

### Elections
- In democracies, elections are very important to policies
    - Determine whether they survive
    - The act of voting is one of the simplest and most frequently performed political acts
    - By aggregating these votes, citizens can make collective decisions about their future leaders and public policies
    - Elections are one of the few devices thorugh which diverse interests can be expressed equally and comprehensively

### Competitive Parties in Govt
- Ability to impliment policies is determined by the nature of the electoral outcome
    - Winning control of legislature and executive
    - Question of level of support: system produces majority outcome without a majority of voter support
- Coalition Governments
- The aggregation of interest at the executive ratherthan electoral level can have both costs and benefits
- Minority interests ignored
- Majority interests dominate

### Cooperation and Conflict in Competitive Party Systems
- Majoritarian Two Party System
- Majority-coalition System
- Multiparty System
- Consensual Paty Systems
- Conflictual Party Systems
- Party systems that have both consentual and conflictual are _consociational_

### Consociational
- Force a coalition

### Authoritarian
- Specialized interest aggregation structure in which aggregation takes place within the ranks of the party or in interactions with business groups, landowners, and institutional groups in the bureacracy or military, citizens hand no opportunity to shape aggregation by choosing between party alternitaves

### Authoritarian Party Systems
- Exclusive Governing Party
    - No interest aggregation outside of upper ranks
- Inclusive Governing Party
    - Govt listens to a few key leaders and groups
    - If groups become threat to power, group will be repressed

### Significance of interest aggregation
- Important determinant shows what govt does for citizens

## Government and Policymanking
- Pivotal stage in the political process by which bills become law or edicts are issued

### Public policy
- To understand public policy, we must know how decisions are made
    - Government agancies are at the core of policymaking
    - Two way process
        - Upward from society
        - Downward from the government

### Constitutions
- Basic rules conceerning decision making, rights and the distrbution of authority
- Prompts for constitutional formation
    - The result of some kind of break: war, revolution, or rebellion
    - New rules have to accommodate new internal and external rules
- The UK does not have a constitution
    - Instead has _customs_, _conventions_ and _ordinary_ statutes

### Definitions
- Rule of law
    - Government cannot take action that has not been authorized by law and ctizens can be punished only for actions that violate an existing law
- Decision Rules
    - The basic rules governing how decisions are made, setting up the agencies and offices with specific powers assigning them territorial and functional jurisdiction, and the like
- Egalitarian
    - Each memver has the same voting power (though presiding offices have the power to break a vote)
- Heirarchical
    - In voting and decision making, everybody is supposed to defer to his or her superior in a pure heirarchy, only the vote of the person at the very top
- Constitutional regimes
    - systems in which the powers of various government units are definded and limited by a written constitution, statues and customs

### Democracy and Authoritarianism
- The basic decision rules of political systems - both democratic and authoritarian - differ along three important dimensions
    - The seperation of powers between different branches of government
    - The geographic distribution of authority between the centeral govt and lower levels such as states, provinces, or municipalities
    - Limitations of governmental authority

### Parliaments and the Confidence Relationship
- The trust factor in a parliamentary system through which the prime miniister and his or her cabinet must at all times enjoy the confidence of the parliamentary majority
- Whenever the parliamentary majority for whatever reason expresses its lack of confidence (through a no-confidence vote), the prime minister and all other cabinet members have to resign
- on the other hand, the prime minister typically has the power to dissolve parliament and call new elections at any time (as of 2011, this is no longer the case in the UK)
- The parliamentary majority's dismissal power and the prime minister's dissolution power, make the two branches mutually dependant
- Induces agreements betweeen them by foring the executive branch to be acceptable to the parliamentary majority
- Thus parliamentary democracies do not experience the form of divided government that is common under presidentialism, when the party that controls the presidency does not control the legislature

### Democracy: Semi-Presidential
- Not all democracies fit neatly inthe teh presidential or parliamentary category; some are semi-presidential, or hybrid parliamentary-presidential systems
    - Type of democracy that incorporates aspects of both the presidential and parliamentary systems
    - In sone, the president and the ligislature are seperateley elected (as in presidential systems), but the president has the power to dissolve the legislature (as in parliamentary systems)
    - The cabinet may be appointed by the president (as in presidential systems), but subject to dismissal by the liglsature (as in parliamentary systems)

### Government policymaking institutions
- Ther eare three ypes of government institutions involved in oplicymaking are
    - The legislative assembly
    - The chief executive
    - The higher levels of bureaucracy

### How to Check the Top Policymakers
- Controlling excesses of the top political leaders is challenging
    - _Authoritarian systems_: problematic
    - _Democracies_: procedures vary between types of systems
        - _Parliamentary system_: removed virtually at any time
        - _Presidential system_: impeachment
            - Associated with constritutions having powerful presidencies with fixed terms of office
        - Ultimate control of democratic order is periodic and competitive elections

### Assemvlies
- Almost all contemporary political systems have assemvlies
    - More than 80% of the countries belonging to the UN
    - Vary in structure - bicameralism is common
    - Differ in their internal organization
    - All have a committee structure

### Assembly Functions
- Deliverate, devate, and vote on policies that come before them
- Typically also control public spending decisions
- Some have important appointment powers
- Some may serve as a court of appeals
- Range in terms of their role as policymaking agencies: US - highly active role, National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, rubberstamp
- Assemblies should not only be viewed as legislative bodies

### Political Executives
- In modern states, the executive branch is by far the largest, the most complex, and typically most powerful
- Chief executies
    - Single or split
    - Divided between effective power over policy

### The cabinet
- In many political systems the Cabinet is the most important collective decision-making body
    - Very powerful in parliamentary systems
- Selection
    - Presidential systems: presidential prerogative with legislative approval, president can dismiss cabinet members, legislature severely limited in this area
    - Parliamentary systems: formation depends on the result of parliamentary elections and on the composition of parliament
        - Majority single-party cabinet vs coalition cabinet

### Functions of Chief Executive
- Typically the most important structure in policymaking
    - The executive normally initiates new policies
    - May have role in adoption
    - Typically has veto powers
    - Oversees policy implementation
    - Recruitment function
    - Conduct of executive
    - Central role in communication, in explaniing and building support for new policies
    - Improving performance in various sectors in society and economy

### The bureaucracy
- Large organizations in charge of implementing public policy
    - Size has increased in many governments across the globe
    - Civil service
- Functions
    - Almost alone in implementing and enforcing laws and regulations
    - May articulate and aggregate interests
    - Adjudication
    - Involved in communication

### Features of Bureaucracies
- Decision making is based on fixed and official jurisdictions, rules and regulations
- There are formal and specialized educaitonal or training requirements for each position
- There is a _heirarchical command structure_
