# Foundations of Comparative Politics

### Politics
- Has to do with human decisions
- Inherently social
- No such thing as _political solitaire_
- Political decisions take place within the community we call a _political system_ `public sphere`
- But most social decisions are made in a _private sphere_
- Politics is _social_, _public_, and _authoritative_

### Political Science
- The study of human decisions

### Authority
- Power vested in individuals or groups with expectations that decisions will be carried out and respected
- Those with political authority have access to _means of coercion_ to _force_ and _dominate_
- Politics ultimiteley refers to the use of authoritative and _coercive means_, who gets to employ _means of coersion_ and for what purposes

## Comparative Politics

### Subject Of Study
- Comparing the nature of politics and the political process across different political systems

### Method of study
- Comparing politics across different political systems and why we do so

## What Is A Government

### What Is A Government?
- The organizations or individuals empowered to make binding decisions on behalf of a particular community

### Nightwatchman State
- Provide defense and uphold law, not intervening in the daily lives of citizens as long as they don't break any fundamental laws

### Welfare State
- Focused on providing for the people 

### Regulatory State
- Economic controls, nationalization, regulating and intervening in certain aspects of citizens' lives

# State of Nature
- Philosopheres used their ideas about the state of nature to identify an ideal _social contract_

## Contrasting views of the State of Nature

### Thomas Hobbes
- Pessimist
- Thought that the natural state of humans was evil

### Jean Jacques-Rousseau
- Optimist
- Saw the state of nature as ideal
- Thought that humans were naturally good

### John Locke
- Believed in _limited government_
- In the middle

### Is Government the problem or the solution?
_this question is unanswered and causes a lot of tension in several states_

## Contrasting Views on the Existance of Government

### Why do some argue **for** government
- Community / Nation-Building
    - Helps create a national politcal culture
- Security and order
- Protecting property and other rights
- Promoting economic efficiency and growth
- Social Justice
- Protecting / Providing for the weak

### When does government become the **problem**
- Violation of basic rights
- Economic Inefficiency
    - Monopolies, Job Protection
- Government for private gain
    - _Rent-Seeking_: self-interested political pursuit of private gain
    - _Rents_: benefits created through government intervention in the economy
- Vested Interests
    - Individuals, groups, or firms that benefit from specific government jobs, contracts, or policies have a "special" interest in existing government; once established, agencies and policies tend to live on far beyond their usefulness (i.e. the House of Lords in the UK)

# Systems

## What is a system?

### Properties of Systems
- Has a set of interdependent parts
- Has boundaries toward outside environment with which it interacts

### What is a _Political System_
- Set of institutions, shch as parliaments, bureaucracies, and courts, that formulate and implement the collective goals of a society or of groups within it.
- Rule of _legitimagey_ preffered over _rule of force_
    - Poor legitimacy results in public policy failure
- Outside institutions such as churhces, schools, corporations, media, ect. make up outside _environment_ of political systems

### What is _Legitimacy_
- The quality or state of being legitimate
- Authenticity
- The popular acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a regime
- Basically... legitimacy is the _right to rule_

### What is a _state_
- Political system that has _sovereignty_
- What is _sovereignty_
    - Independant legal authority over a population in a particular territory, based on self-determination; sovereignty rests with political decision-makers
    - Sovereignty is never absollute; every _State_ has constraints on their internal and external sovereignty
- _Internal Sovereignty_: the right, without external intervention, to determine matters having to do with one's own citizens
- _External Sovereignty_

### _State_ vs. _Country_ vs. _Nation_ vs. _Nation-State_
- A _state_ is a political system that has sovereignty, a self-governing political entity
- What is a _country_?
    - The term _country_ can be used interchangably with _state_
- What is a _nation_?
    - A tightly-knit group of people who share a common culture
- What is a _nation-state_?
    - A _nation_ which has the same borders as a _state_

### States in the World
- The United Nations currently has 193 member-states
- **But** this does not necessarily equal the actual number of _states_ in the world
- Numbers from varying sources range from 193 to just over 200
- **And** we also have to consider _Supranational Organizations_

### What is a _Supranational Organization_?
- An international organization, or union, whereby member states transcend national boundaries or interests to share in the decision-making and vote on issues pertaining to the wider grouping
- Some such organizations are political in nature, some focus on economic matters, whereas others combine politics, economics, and social matters
- Examples of _Supranational Organizations_:
    - The European Union
    - The United Nations
    - BRICS
    - The World Bank
    - World Trade Organization

### How can _Supranational Organizations_ impact a _State's_ Sovereignty?
- _Supranational Organizations_ attempt to and / or succeed in exerting controls or authority in sovereign _states_
- Let's use the _European Union_ as our example:
    - States that join the _European Union_ have had to give up large parts of their sivereignty to this _Supranational Organization_ in order to create a common market economy that can compete globally.
    - This specific issue of sovereignty has created a lot of conflict in the United Kingdon regardin gheir membership in the EU. Should the remain in the EU or pull their membership?

### The Diversity of _States_
- Since WWII, ~127 new countries have joined the 68 _states_ that existed in 1945
    - Largest group of new _states_ in Sub-Saharan Africa
    - More than 20 new countries formed in the 1990s
        - Mostly the successor states of the Soviet Union

### The diversity of _states_
- Big and small states
    - Vatican City - smallest legally independant entity in geographic size and population
    - Russia - largest landmass
    - China and India - largest populations
- Political implications of geographic and population size?
    - Big countries are not always the most important
    -Small ones can be **very** important: Cuba, Israel, Vatican City
- No matter the grographic size, population size, or other points, of difference, **all** states face similar challenges:
    - Building community
    - Fostering economic and social development
    - Advancing democracy and civil liberties

### Challenges with Building Community
- Absence of a common identity can have severe political consequences as conflicts can occor over national, ethnic, or religious ties
    - Easier for homogeneous
- Nationality and Identity
- Language
- Religious Beliefs and Fundamentalism
    - Fundamentalism is charactarized as a backlash against modernity

### What is a _political cleavage_
- The national, ethnic, religios, and linguistic division that systematically affect political allegiances and policies
- What is a _Cumulative Cleavage_
    - Pitting the same people against each other on many different issues
- What is a _Cross Cutting Cleavage_
    - Groups that share a common interest on one issue are likely to be on opposite sides of a different issue

### Fostering Development
- A political system cannod satisfy its citizens if it does not foster social and economic development
- _Living Standards_
    - _globalization_, _democratization_, and _marketization_
    - HDI: _Human Development Index_
- Structure of the labor force
    - _Agriculture_ vs _Urbanization_
- Wide gaps in living standards still exist across countries of the world
- Productivity requires resources to develop a skilled and halthy labor force and an infrastructure that supports material welfare

### Economic Indicators
- What is _GNP_?
    - _GNP_: Gross National Product, **total economic output per person**
- What is _GDP_?
    - _GDP_: Gross Domestic Product, a measure of a country's overall economic output; **the market value of all final goods and services made within the borders of a country in a year.**
- What is _PPP_
    - _Purchasing Power Parity_

### Criteria for _Developed_ Countries
- Lower percentage of population involved in agriculture industry
- Higher literacy rates & education levels attained
- Low infant mortality rates
- Higher life expectancy
- Communication media (more telephones, radios, TVs per person)

### Problems of Economic Development
- Unequal distrivbution of resources and opportunities are among the most serious causes of political conflict
    - Large _GNP_ may conceal signiicant differences in distribution of these resources
- A country's politics are affected by internal divisions of incone, wealth, etc.
    - Some countries work to limit these divisions: India
    - Economic inequality in America is as great as several poor countries, such as China and Egypt
- First stages of industrialization may actually increase income inequality even though economic deleopment may narrow the differences eventually, but that is not guaranteed
- Another correlate of development is _population growth_
    - Generally population growth occors when popsitive things, like helath care improvement and increased living standards, occor
    - Rapid population growth, however, can pose policy challenges for many developing nations.
    - Fertility rates
    - _Coercive Politices_: China
- Economic growth can also lead to _environmental costs_
    - Despoiled forests, depleated soils and fisheries, polluted air and water, nuclear waste, endangered species

### Advancing Democracy and Civil Liberties
- _Democratization_ is the second major force transforming contemporary political systems
    - Includes the enhancement of human rights and the expnasion of freedom
- Waves of Democratization (as per Samuel Huntingon)
    - First: During the first half of the 20th century: Western States
    - Second: 1943 to 19602: newly independant satates and defeated authoritarian powers
    - Third: 1974 involving Southern Europe

## The most important general distinciton in classifying political systems is _Democratic Systems_ vs _Authoritarian Systems_

### What is  a _Democracy_
- A political system in which citizens enjoy a number of basic civil and political rights and in which their most important political sleaders are elected in free and fair electrions and are accountable under the _rule of law_
- Democracy does not gaurantee human rights and civil liverties for _everyone_

### What is _Authoritarianism_
- Lacks one or several of the defning features of a democracy
- Oligarchy: "rule of a few" important rights withheld from the majority
- Totalitarianism

# Comparing Political Systems
## Why do we compare? How do we compare? Structures and functions of Government

### Why we compare
- People study politics through comparison
- Comparative analysis helps us develop explanations and test theories of the ways in which political processes work and in which political change occors
- Comparing the past and present of our nation and comparing our experience with that of other deepens our understanding of our own institutions

### How We Compare
- Firts stage in the study of politics is description
- To describe it we need a set of concepts that are clearly defined and well understood
    - _Conceptual frameworks_
    - The easier this set of concepts is to understand and the more generally it can be applied, the more helpful it is to the study of politics

### What is a _Conceptual Framework_
- A set of concepts taht are clearly defined and well understood, which are used in order to describe politics

### The Political System Environment
- To utilize a structural-functional systems framework to compare political systems we need to discuss four general concepts
    - _System_ - suggests an object having interdependent parts, acting within a setting or an environment with boundaries towards taht outside environment
    - _Structure_ - Specialized agencies that governments create in order to carry out its many activities, such as parliaments, bureaucracies, administrative, agencies, and courts
    - _Function_ - The actions or activities assigned to or required or expected of a person or group
    - _Inputs_ - Term denoting either an enterance or changes that are inserted into a system and which activate / modify a process

### Political Systems
- What is a _political system_?
    - A set of institutions and agencies concerned iwth formulating and implementing the collective goals of a society or of groups within it
- What is _a government / the state_
    - The policymaking parts of the _politcal system_
    - Decisions of governments are normally backed up by legitimate coercion, obedience may be compelled

### Political Structures
- 6 structures in a system
- What are the 6 types of political structures
    - Legislature
    - Executive
    - Courts
    - Beaurocracies
    - Political Parties
    - Interest Groups

### Political Structures and Functions
- Structures perform functions, which in tern enable the government to formulate, implement, and enforce its policies.
    - Policies reflect the goals; the agencies provide the means
    - How might comparisons of these political structures be challenging?
        - Somse structures, such as ruling military councils or governing royal families, are found in only a few countries
        - Similar structures may have very different functions across political systems

### Political System: Process Functions
- _Process Functions_: distinctive activites _necessary for policy to be made and implemented_ in any kind of political system
    - _Interest Articulation_
        - Involves individuals and groups expressing their needs and demands
    - _Interest Aggregation_
        - Combines different demands into policy proposals backed by significant political resources
    - _Policymaking_
        - Decides what policy proposals are to become authoritative rules
    - _Policy Implimentation_
        - carries out and enforces public policies; policy adjudication settles disputes about their application

### Political System: System Functions
- _System Functions_: three additional functions which are not directly involved in making and implementing public policy - socialization, recruitment, and communication are fundamentally important
    - They determine whether or not the system will be maintained or changed
        - _Political Socialization_: involves families, schools, communications media, churches, and all the various political structures that develop, reinforce and transform the political culture, the attitudes of political significance in the soiety

### Political System: Policy Functions
- _Policy Functions (AKA Outputs)_: the implimentation of the political processes
    - The substantive impacts on society, the economy, and the culture, which include various forms of _regulation_ of behavior, _extractions_ of resources in the forms of taxes and the like, and _distribution_ of benefits and services to various groups

### Structural-Functional Approach
- Allows us to examine how the same functions are performed in different countries, or in the same country at two different points in time
- _Case Study: Russia_
    - _How could we apply this approach to Russia_
    - The govt. and its structures and functions of the 1985 Siviet Union can be compared to the government and its structures and functions of modern-day Russia.

### The Policy Level
- _Imporrtant question_: What dod the differences in structure and function do for the interest, needs, and aspirations of people?
    - The is the _policy level_ of the political system
- We call the outputs of a political system- its extractions, distributions, regulation, and symbolic acts- its _policy performance_
- Example:
    - _Input_: American spending on educaiton; more than any other people in the world
    - _Output_: U.S. children perform less well in subjects such as mathematics than do children in some other countries that spend substantially less
- The _policy level_ also includes the _outcomes of public policy_
- What are _outcomes_?
    - Information, event, object, or state of being produced as a result or consequene of a plan, process, accident, effort or other similar action or occurrence
- Outcomes generally result in _new inputs_, in _new demands_ for legislation or for _administrative action_, and in increases or decreases in the amount of support given to the political system and incumbent officeholders
    - Other forces: conditions in the internal environment, conditions in the larger external world, and simple chance may frustrate the most thoughtfully crafted programs and plans
- Evaluation
    - Assessing performance and outcomes

### How We Explain
- Once we descrive politics with the help of a conceptual framework, we then must explain it
    - Identifying the relationships between political phenomena
    - Ideally we want to put many political relationships in casual terms
- Theories are statements about casual relationships between general classes of events
    - Example: What causes democracy, war, or welfare policies?
    - Theories need to be testable
    - Good theory holds up after many trials
